# First Group Project

# Project title
The name of our project is FRESH FINDER. We completed this project as part of our Full Stack Flex Coding Program under UNC Chapel Hill.

# Motivation
We are looking to solve the problem of locating Farmer’s Markets in our communities.  With the recent rise in the cost of produce/ goods, we aim to bring a local market to the consumer that is worthy of placing fresh quality foods on the table at any given moment.

# Build status
This is our first release with hope of future improvements. 

# How this app works
In this web application, we have created an app to find a farmer's market close to you based on your zip code. The app will then pull 10 markets. You can click on a particular market and the rest of the details will show up. The detailed info tells you about the products, the schedule, the address and also the google link to navigate to that address. Here is the link of the app:

# Built with
We used javaScript, jQuery and Materialize. 

# API Reference
We used USDA Farmer's Market API and Google Maps API.

# Contribute
To contribute to this project, please fork this project or clone the repo to your local machine.

# Challenges
We had to find a way to get our API from the USDA to fully function - this API uses JSONP as a data type, and it was harder to find information to fully support our code. 
We also found out Google Maps API is harder than Embedding Google Maps. Having the markers work in conjunction with the markets’ addresses was also challenging.
We chose to work with Materialize as a new technology. That was also very challenging at times. Poor documentation and lack of good examples on the materialize website was discouraging. 

# Improvements
Labels - we would love to have labels that hover over each selection on the actual Google Map, if given the time.
Scalability - while this program can work for any location with a zip code, we thought it would be great to have the entire world supported if that were possible.  We would more than likely look into other APIs to use across the globe, and implement those into our working code to support that feature.
Using calendar API, we would also like to have the ability to add reminder or calendar events.

# Credits
This was done as part of the school program. Ryan Brown, Tiffany Brincefield and Prasen Gope are the team members.
